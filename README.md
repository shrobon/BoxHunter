# BOX HUNTER
![alt tag](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5L6sQPsKnRfQmdBZk5fTlFxQlE)
This game based on the Unity Roll a Ball Game and was my first assigment for the course MM806 (Virtual Reality and Telepresence)at University of Alberta. The gameplay and UI modifications have been listed below. I have hosted the basic version of this game on
[http://shrobon.com/webgl.html] http://shrobon.com/webgl.html
Use the arrow keys to move the ball and collect the boxes, while avoiding the capsules.
As an improvement, i have recently ported this game for the Google Cardboard, with the ball movements being controlled using raycast.

### Gameplay
I have considered the following changes in the GAMEPLAY, to make it more entertaining:
1. Now the player with the ball has just 3 lives.
2. If he collides with the boundary or the Danger Objects, he loses a life.
3. A timer has been set up to judge which player can collect all the Cube objects faster than the others.
 
## UI Modifications
1. The Main Screen has an Image Object with a Play button, which on clicking takes you to the game Screen.
2. There is a restart button, to reload the Scene.
3. There is a Quit Button for quitting out from the Game(Works in the PC BUILD , but not on the WebBuild- Browser issue)
